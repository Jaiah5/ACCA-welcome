ACCA Fellow Welcome

Take a look at the Fellow welcome email campaign for ACCA. The email is sent to affiliates to provide them with their certificate to welcome them into fellowship and it contains a GIF with dynamic first and last name fields to display the name of the affiliate. Deploying a GIF as a background image in an email can be very difficult due to potential rendering issues especially on Outlook (which is known for being quite a problematic email client for rendering) but this email template uses HTML, CSS, and VML markup language to overcome the rendering issues. It is also optimised for Dark mode/Gmail Dark mode, mobile, and Outlook.
